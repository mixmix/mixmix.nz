>Protozoa&lt;/a> is a tech coop, and we write open source code.
This is a little bit about what that means, and how open source is the foundation on which we&amp;rsquo;re building an aspirational future.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently published a new feauture for &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Patchbay&lt;/a> - an open source project I maintain.
It allows you to easily @-mention people in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>scuttleverse&lt;/a>.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward because it&amp;rsquo;s a decentralised space where identity is subjective - many people have more than one use-name. (I gave &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K18XssVBg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a whole talk on subjectiviy here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I mention Mikey by a name that people in our coding context will be familiar with (dinosaur).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why is this significant?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m proud of this feature, but the more important parts of this story are the open source and the cooperative culture making this possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="open-source">Open source
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the next couple of days, I&amp;rsquo;m going to generalise this code into a &lt;em>module&lt;/em> called &lt;code>patch-mentions&lt;/code>.
Then I&amp;rsquo;m going to propose changes to Patchbay, and a sister project called &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Patchwork&lt;/a> so that they use use this new module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way everyone gets the new functionality, and when we find bugs in what I&amp;rsquo;ve done, we&amp;rsquo;ll all benefit from the solution.
I&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to use this in subsequent contracting work - a massive speed and reliability boost for myself and for clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I&amp;rsquo;ve actually already done this with a couple of other modules &lt;code>patch-profile&lt;/code> (an easy profile editor) and &lt;code>patch-settings&lt;/code> (which manages client preference settings).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re talking to a programmer about what excites them about open source, this is probably the heart of it.
Every time someone generously shares their work, we save hours / days / weeks of work, and are able to channel these savings into things that matter - like making more accessible interfaces, or building a feature to flag abusive actors (next on my todo list).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cooperatives">Cooperatives
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Protozoa is a worker owner cooperative.
While I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, Piet and Dominic are hard at work on different things - contract work, and forming collaborations with other deceltralised projects (we&amp;rsquo;re currently crushing on the &lt;a class="link" href="https://economicspace.agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Economic Space Agency&lt;/a> a bit).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For us, contributing to the commons is an important part of our work - it makes all our future work better, and helps build working relationships with other excellent humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of that:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://tableflip.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tableflip&lt;/a> are a UK based tech coop we&amp;rsquo;ve been working with.
We met them through the scuttleverse and this is a calendar invite to a catchup planning more work in the future.
By working together, we&amp;rsquo;re able to work on bigger and more exciting projects with the confidence that we can expand to support each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cal invite here is another tool we built is called &lt;code>gatherings&lt;/code>.
It&amp;rsquo;s a module Piet and I made to enable more community interaction.
Other gatherings I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the past week in include &amp;ldquo;Art~Hack Wellington: decommidify your creativity&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Westhaven Car Boot sale&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Bad Ukulele Club&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels amazing to have been able to support more connections between people, and to be doing business in a values aligned space - I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know TableFlip&amp;rsquo;s email addresses&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>If you&amp;rsquo;re an excellent human with a rad project you&amp;rsquo;d like to collaborate on, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you.
